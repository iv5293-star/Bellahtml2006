                <h2>Reweirding The Internet</h2>
                <divid="post1">
                    <p>The web used to be a tool for people to pair with their own creativity, making it more personal, allowing for experimentation and thinking. However, throughout its evolution it has been dominated by corporations and algorithms, making it more standardized, similar to a lot of things in the world today. “Reweirding” the internet stands for reclaiming the web space for personal expression, bringing back handmade websites, unique layouts, and personality. However this can only achieve this by opposing this algorithmic driven society that platforms like Instagram feeds and TikTok feeds provide us with. </p>
                <p>Using GitHub and HTML to create my own website is a form of this movement to “reweirden” the internet. As we mindlessly search things up and scroll through the internet, many of us are not really sure how these websites are created– the coding, design, etc. That said, having done something similar in middle school, where I had to code my own website and code my own video game, this project really helped to re-open my eyes to how hand-coding can be hard and messy but also so rewarding and expressive compared to mindlessly scrolling through standardized and algorithmic based platforms. This builds awareness of how digital spaces are constructed, allowing us to “make” it rather than simply “use” it, thus restoring a sense of authorship which has been lost in automated design. </p>
                <p>In Trevor Paglen’s, Invisible Images (Your Pictures are Looking At You), there is an emphasis on how images online are made for machine vision systems, such as facial recognition, surveillance, and classification, rather than for the human eyes, demonstrating a shift in the from a place of human expression towards a place of machine legibility. The modern internet is encouraging content that machines can easily analyze and  recognize, rather than supporting an environment in which messy HTML websites, unique aesthetics and layouts, and text-based art can thrive. Furthermore, the piece, Floodnet (Electronic Disturbance Theatre), by Mendi and Keith Obadike, demonstrates a “disturbance” of an otherwise smooth digital space, revealing how digital spaces are often engineered with ulterior motives. Addressing the racialized invisibility in digital infrastructures, it continues to reveal how power, identity, and bias operate behind interfaces that claim to be neutral. Through its use of performative coding, this artwork shows how writing code can be used as an act to reclaim agency and authorship over the internet, inspiring users to actually manipulate the internet rather than just extracting from it. Like hand-coding or ASCII art, it “reweirds” the internet by inserting human expression, emotion, and thought rather than predictableness. </p>

                <p>Therefore I chose to create a butterfly for my ASCII Art, symbolizing the transformation, in this case, metamorphosis, of our class's HTML websites trying to re-transform the current digital landscape. Because this image is not smooth, high-resoluted, or a typical layout, it disrupts the expectations of modern web design. Hence performing the reintroduction of human strangeness, imperfection and creativity into the digital space, revealing that the internet is still capable of being a platform for innovation and imagination.</p>
