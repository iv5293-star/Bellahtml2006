                <div id="post1">
                    <p>Sports: Throughout my life, I have participated in multiple sports including swimming, gymnastics, soccer, and dance. While soccer has always been my favorite, a close second was definitely gymnastics. Tumbling was my absolute favorite, but when it came to bars I was always terrified. However, I soon quit this to spend more time dancing. I went to Logrea Dance Academy where I participated in ballet, tap, and jazz classes, taking up to eight hours of dance a week. Additionally, during this time I also played soccer, quickly realizing it was my favorite sport of them all. However, if I could learn a new sport now, I would love to learn how to figure skate.</p>

                    <p>The NY Canid Project: During high school I was part of a three year science research program where I had to conduct my own study. During this time I started The NY Canid Project where I analyzed the impacts of urbanization on coyotes and red foxes throughout New York. This project included finding a mentor, creating a research plan / methodology, analyzing my data, writing a research paper, and attending various science competitions and conferences.</p>

                    <p>Travel: Places I have traveled to include Maine, Maryland, Vermont, Peru, Italy, and Costa Rica. Some of my favorites include Peru because part of my family lives there, Italy because I got to play soccer there, and Costa Rica thanks to all of the beautiful views and beaches. Places oto travel to that are on my bucket list include Spain, France, and Greece.</p>
